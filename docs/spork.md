| **Concurrency & Shreds** ChucK is able to run many processes concurrently (the process behave as if they are running in parallel). A ChucKian process is called a *shred*. To *spork* a shred means creating and adding a new process to the virtual machine. Shreds may be sporked from a variety of places, and may themselves spork new shreds.  ChucK supports sample-synchronous, non-preemptive concurrency. Via the timing mechanism. any number of programs/shreds can be automatically *shreduled* and synchronized use the timing information. A *shreduler* in the virtual machine does the shreduling. The concurrency is 'sample-synchronous', meaning that inter-process audio timing is guaranteed to be precise to the sample. Note that each process/shred does not necessarily need to know about each other - it only has to deal with time locally. The virtual machine will make sure things happen correctly "across the board". Finally, concurrency - like timing - is deterministic in ChucK.  The simplest way to to run shreds concurrently is to specify them on the command line:   ```      %> chuck foo.ck bar.ck boo.ck  ```   The above command runs chuck on foo.ck, bar.ck, and boo.ck concurrently. There are other ways to run shreds concurrently (see [on-the-fly programming commands](../program/otfp.html)). Next, we show how to create new shreds from within ChucK programs.  [View sample code](../examples/index.html#spork) for shreds & sporking  **sporking shreds (in code)** To *spork* means to shredule a new shred.  To spork a shred, use the **spork** keyword/operator:   * **spork** dynamically sporks shred from a function call* this operation is sample-synchronous, the new shred is shreduled to execute immediately* the parent shred continues to execute, until time is advanced (see [manipulating time](time.html)) or until the parent explicitly yields (see next section).* in the current implementation, when a parent shred exits, all child shreds all exit (this         behavior will be enhanced in the future.)* **spork**ing a functions returns reference to the new shred,           note that this operation does not return what functions returns - the ability to get back the return           value at some later point in time will be provided in a future release.  ```      // define function go()     fun void go()     {         // insert code     }      // spork a new shred to start running from go()     spork ~ go();      // spork another, store reference to new shred in offspring     spork ~ go() => Shred @ offspring;  ```   a slightly longer example:   ```     // define function    fun void foo( string s )    {        // infinite time loop        while( true )        {            // print s            <<< s >>>;            // advance time            500::ms => now;        }    }        // spork shred, passing in "you" as argument to foo    spork ~ foo( "you" );    // advance time by 250 ms    250::ms => now;    // spork another shred    spork ~ foo( "me" );        // infinite time loop - to keep child shreds around    while( true )         1::second => now;  ```   also see [function](func.html) section for more information on working with functions.  **the 'me' keyword** The **me** keyword (type Shred) refers the current shred.  Sometimes it is useful to suspend the current shred *without advancing time*, and let other shreds shreduled for the current time to execute. **me.yield()** does exactly that. This is often useful immediately after sporking a new shred, and you would like for that shred to have a chance to run but you do not want to advance time yet for yourself.   ```      // spork shred     spork ~ go();      // suspend the current shred ...     // ... give other shreds (shreduled for 'now') a chance to run     me.yield();  ```   It may also be useful to exit the current shred. For example if a MIDI device fails to open, you may exit the current shred.   ```      // make a MidiIn object     MidiIn min;      // try to open device 0 (chuck --probe to list all device)     if( !min.open( 0 ) )     {         // print error message         <<< "can't open MIDI device" >>>;         // exit the current shred         me.exit();     }  ```   You can get the shred id:   ```      // print out the shred id     <<< me.id(); >>>;  ```   These functions are common to all shreds, but yield() and exit() are commonly used with the current shred.  **using machine.add()** **Machine.add( string path )** takes the path to a chuck program, and sporks it. Unlike **spork ~**, there is no parent-child relationship between the shred that calls the function and the new shred that is added. This is useful for dynamically running stored programs.   ```      // spork "foo.ck"     Machine.add( "foo.ck" );  ```   Presently, this returns the id of the new shred, not a reference to the shred. This will likely be changed in the future.  Similarly, you can remove shreds from the virtual machine.   ```      // add     Machine.add( "foo.ck" ) => int id;      // remove shred with id     Machine.remove( id );      // add     Machine.add( "boo.ck" ) => id      // replace shred with "bar.ck"     Machine.replace( id, "bar.ck" );  ```  **inter-shred communication** Shreds sporked in the same file can share the same global variables. They can use time and events to synchronize to each other. (see [events](event.html)) Shreds sporked from different files can share data (including events). For now, this is done through a public class with static data (see [classes](class.html)). Static data is not completely implemented! We will fix this very soon!  **command line arguments** ChucK supports passing arbitrary data from the command line into ChucK programs using optional command line arguments. An argument is specified by appending a colon character ":" to the name of the ChucK program to which you wish to send that argument, followed by the argument itself.  ```   %> chuck foo.ck:foo  ```  Multiple arguments can be specified, each separated by the colon character.  ```   %> chuck foo.ck:foo:bar:boo  ```  Furthermore, each ChucK program has its own set of arguments, which are specified separately.  ```   %> chuck foo.ck:foo bar.ck:bar boo.ck  ```  Command line arguments can also be used when using on-the-fly programming facilities of ChucK.  ```   %> chuck + foo.ck:foo bar.ck:bar:boo  ```  **Machine.add()** and **Machine.replace()** accept command line arguments in a similar fashion.  ```      // add foo.ck     // pass foo and bar as command line arguments     Machine.add( "foo.ck:foo:bar" ) => int id;      // replace shred with "bar.ck"     // pass foo and bar as command line arguments     Machine.replace( id, "bar.ck:foo:bar" );  ```  To access command line arguments within a ChucK program, use the **me.args()** and **me.arg()** functions.  ```  // print out all arguments for( int i; i < me.args(); i++ )     <<< me.arg( i ) >>>;  ``` |
