# Enhanced ChucK Library System

This project implements an advanced management system for ChucK code snippets and audio samples, designed to enhance AI-assisted music programming through WebChucK.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

The database is structured around several key entities:

1. **Code Snippets**: Reusable ChucK code with tagging and embeddings
2. **Samples**: Audio files organized in volumes with analytics
3. **Volumes**: Mount points for sample directories
4. **Patterns**: Common musical patterns for composition
5. **Performance Data**: Execution metrics for optimization

### Key Features

#### RAG for Code Generation
- Vector embeddings for semantic search of code snippets
- Musical pattern repository with categorization
- Usage context tracking to understand how patterns are used together

#### Enhanced Sample Management
- Detailed audio analysis (spectral, transient, etc.)
- Relationship tracking between samples
- Intelligent caching with priority-based preloading

#### Performance Analysis
- Execution metrics collection and comparison
- Device-specific optimization suggestions
- Buffer underrun detection

#### Event Tracking
- Session-based event logging
- Detailed tracing for debugging and analytics

## API Endpoints

## Client Integration

The client-side library provides utilities for:

1. **Embedding Management**: Generating and searching vector embeddings
2. **Audio Analysis**: Web Audio API utilities for sample analysis
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to measure execution metrics
4. **Intelligent Preloading**: Predictive loading of samples based on usage patterns

## Integration with AI Assistants

This system allows AI assistants like Claude to:

1. **Make Informed Code Suggestions**: By analyzing past usage patterns and performance
2. **Enhance Sample Selection**: Through intelligent searching of audio characteristics
3. **Optimize Code Performance**: By suggesting improvements based on metrics
4. **Provide Contextual Help**: Using detailed event logs to understand user behavior

## Usage Examples

### Semantic Code Search

```javascript
// Find snippets similar to a reference snippet
const referenceSnippet = await api.getSnippet(42);
const embedding = await generateEmbedding(referenceSnippet.code);
const similarSnippets = await api.searchSnippetsByEmbedding(embedding, 'code_semantic');
```

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Measure and analyze performance
const { result, metrics } = await api.measureChuckPerformance(
  snippetId,
  sessionId,
  executeChuckSnippet
);

// Get optimization suggestions
const comparison = await api.getPerformanceComparison(snippetId);
console.log("Optimization suggestions:", comparison.latest.optimization_suggestions);
```

### Intelligent Sample Loading

```javascript
// Preload high-priority samples before performance
await api.preloadHighPrioritySamples(sessionId, 2);

// Record relationship between samples used together
await api.recordSampleRelationship(kick.id, snare.id, 0.8);
```

## Future Directions

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Add support for collaborative editing and performances
- **UGen Flow Visualization**: Create visual representations of signal flow
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Train models on performance data to automate optimization
- **Enhanced Audio Analysis**: Deeper spectral and perceptual analysis for better sample recommendations
